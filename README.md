# Student Database Management System

This project is our sophomore project for the Database Management System course, made using Python and SQLite. In this student database management system, we can add, delete, update, view, and clear existing records from the database. The Student ID acts as the PRIMARY KEY, and we store the student's name, age, gender, address, and mobile number.
## Features

- **Add Records**: Insert new student records into the database.
- **Delete Records**: Remove existing student records from the database.
- **Update Records**: Modify details of existing student records.
- **View Records**: Display all student records in the database.
- **Clear Records**: Remove all records from the database.
